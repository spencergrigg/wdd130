    <p style="color:rgba(0, 31, 9, 0.582)">Hi everybody, I'm Spencer! I live nearby Rexburg in Kuna Idaho. I've lived my entire life
        in Kuna before coming to Rexburg and now I'm back home and taking my classes online. I'm 
        really excited actually, because I'm going to graduate with my associates this semester!  
    <p style="color:rgba(0, 31, 9, 0.582)">I really loved reading and playing sports. I don't play sports competitively as I like my 
        bones in place and unbroken ;D All joking aside, I do love recreation and music. I've done
        choir and piano for years and now I've taken some dancing classes too! After I finish my 
        associates degree, I'll move to getting my bachelor's degree in CIT. I'm still not 100% sure 
        everything I am going to do with the knowledge I learn from the course, but I think it will
        be really useful in the future to know html and web design, both in my career and as a hobby.</p>
    <p style="color:rgba(0, 31, 9, 0.582)">I am not married yet, but I will be by January of 2025. I am still thinking of how and when
       I am going to propose to my girlfriend yet, but I'm excited for the future! 
    <p style="color:rgba(0, 31, 9, 0.582)">I'm excited to get to know everyone and to learn more in this course! Thanks for visiting my page
       and I hope you have a fantastic day!</p>
