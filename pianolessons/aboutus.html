        <p>Grigg studios started as a small family company back in 2020. As someone who had taken piano lessons for years
            I am so grateful that my mom decided to give me the gift of piano lessons. It was hard at times, but I'll never
            forgot all the years I had driving with my brother to piano lessons each work and complaining about practicing,
            but really I always enjoyed the thrill of gliding my fingers along the keys, making the strings sing their beautiful
            music. As I grew older and became a parent myself, I wanted the same thing for my kids, so I started to teach them 
            lessons. As I watched my children go from playing a faltering "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" to playing Level 1 and 
            Level 2 pieces in no time, it wasn't long before I wanted to share this with kids everywhere. And so I bought a 
            beautiful new piano that would make any kid's eyes shine with wonder and then I set out to share my gift with the 
            children of the world, starting with my little neighborhood. I started by teaching kids in our little community,
            including my neighbors kids and their excitement was contagious. Pretty soon we were taking kids from all around town.
            Now after three years, my wife and I teach more than 30 kids. We love teaching kids of all ages all the way from 1st 
            grade to their 12th grade graduation. If you think piano might be for you or your kids, schedule a lesson to experience</p>
