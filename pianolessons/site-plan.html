      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Grigg studios started as a small family company back in 2020. As someone who had taken piano lessons for years
        I am so grateful that my mom decided to give me the gift of piano lessons. It was hard at times, but I'll never
        forgot all the years I had driving with my brother to piano lessons each work and complaining about practicing,
        but really I always enjoyed the thrill of gliding my fingers along the keys, making the strings sing their beautiful
        music. As I grew older and became a parent myself, I wanted the same thing for my kids, so I started to teach them 
        lessons. As I watched my children go from playing a faltering "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" to playing Level 1 and 
        Level 2 pieces in no time, it wasn't long before I wanted to share this with kids everywhere. And so I bought a 
        beautiful new piano that would make any kid's eyes shine with wonder and then I set out to share my gift with the 
        children of the world, starting with my little neighborhood. I started by teaching kids in our little community,
        including my neighbors kids and their excitement was contagious. Pretty soon we were taking kids from all around town.
        Now after three years, my wife and I teach more than 30 kids. We love teaching kids of all ages all the way from 1st 
        grade to their 12th grade graduation. If you think piano might be for you or your kids, schedule a lesson to experience
        the joy of music. We hope to see you soon!

      <h3>Take Lessons</h3>
      <p>
        Piano lessons are offered both individually, and in groups. Your child will have the option to learn with peers, or in 
        a custom one on one lesson with our teachers.

        Individual Lessons: Individual lessons are great for all ages and they provide an emphasis in preparing solo pieces 
        to play in family recitals or in our annual festival. Students can work towards their trophy cups by earning points through 
        theory tests, festival pieces and concertos. As students progress in their courses they will learn the principles of hand technique,
        music theory, overall confidence in the instrument. Students will develop a strong musical foundation, and they'll learn a variety of
        their favorite songs while they play! Half hour and hour long classes are offered weekly. 

        Group Lessons: During group lessons kids will be part of groups according to age and ability. Students who enroll in group lessons will
        learn the precious skills needed to play the piano while also benefiting from the ear training, sight reading, and rhythym skills that come
        with playing in a group. Students will also progress rapidly as they play along side their friends in challenges like note naming and scale sequencing.
        Classes are offered every week for one hour.

        Pricing 
          Individual lessons: Focus is on learning solo pieces and strengthening individual technique and theory. 
            30 minute lessons: $15 / lesson
            45 minute lessons: $20 / lesson
            60 minute lessons: $30 / lesson

          Group lesson: Focus is on conquering theory challenges as a team, strengthening sight reading and learning to play as part of an ensemble.
            60 minute lessons: $20 / lesson

        Lesson Times
        Students are welcome to enroll in both individual and group lessons.
          Individual lessons will be scheduled throughout the week [Mondays through Fridays]. Students may enroll for any available time slot throughout 
            the week.
          Group lessons will be provided throughout the day Wednesdays and Saturdays.
