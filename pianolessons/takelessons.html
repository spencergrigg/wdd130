        <p> Piano lessons are offered both individually, and in groups. Your child will have the option to learn with peers, or in 
            a custom one on one lesson with our teachers.
    
            Individual Lessons: Individual lessons are great for all ages and they provide an emphasis in preparing solo pieces 
            to play in family recitals or in our annual festival. Students can work towards their trophy cups by earning points through 
            theory tests, festival pieces and concertos. As students progress in their courses they will learn the principles of hand technique,
            music theory, overall confidence in the instrument. Students will develop a strong musical foundation, and they'll learn a variety of
            their favorite songs while they play! Half hour and hour long classes are offered weekly. 
    
            Group Lessons: During group lessons kids will be part of groups according to age and ability. Students who enroll in group lessons will
            learn the precious skills needed to play the piano while also benefiting from the ear training, sight reading, and rhythym skills that come
            with playing in a group. Students will also progress rapidly as they play along side their friends in challenges like note naming and scale sequencing.
            Classes are offered every week for one hour.
    
            Pricing 
              Individual lessons: Focus is on learning solo pieces and strengthening individual technique and theory. 
                30 minute lessons: $15 / lesson
                45 minute lessons: $20 / lesson
                60 minute lessons: $30 / lesson
    
              Group lesson: Focus is on conquering theory challenges as a team, strengthening sight reading and learning to play as part of an ensemble.
                60 minute lessons: $20 / lesson
    
            Lesson Times
